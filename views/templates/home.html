    <p>
      A critically thinking and creative web developer. I enjoy finding the most efficient solutions to problems and implementing those solutions in a team environment. I work hard until the project is complete, staying focused on my work throughout. I am well suited for roles in which I am able to work independently but I also value having the support of my team and/or supervisor(s). Â I bring stability and calm to every organization and team.
